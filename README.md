#### Algorithmic Trading Basics

Predefined set of rules, combined into an algorithm.     
Developed with a programming language and ran by a computer.     
Can be used for both manual and automaded trading.    

For high-end systems automating the execution with Java or C++ is used as they are way faster than Python.(mangaed Language vs unmanged Language).      

#### ML in Trading

(supervised Learning).     
- Signal generation through prediction. For example buy or sell signals, based on predicted returns or directions.    
- Risk management through prediction. For example determinig position sizing and stop-loss levels to have more opitmized risk

(Unsupervised Learning).     
- Extract insights from the data. For example discover patterns,    
  relationships and structures.


Challenges to applying ML in trading:
(Reflexivity)
- Very hard to predict returns or prices.
- Quite hard to predict return signs.   
- Hard to predict economic indicator.   
- Not so hard to predict volatility.     

Futhermore, some technical challenges are overfitting and  
generalization, non-stationarity and regime shifts, as well  
interpretation of black-box models.    


- The Workflow Process.  
1. Collect and prepare the data.    
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy.   
3. Coding the model.    
4. Backtest the strategy.    

#### The Key Takeaways From This Course.  
You will learn high-level concepts in quantitative finance.    
Practical machine learning in trading.   
Develop a project from idea to backtested results.    
We will NOT automate or executes any trade.   
Purely research proeject for educational purposes.
